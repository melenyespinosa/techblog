	<p> Humans Need Not Apply shows us how soon robots will replace humans in no time. They will soon take many jobs because they are skilled. They can take over cashier, baristas, etc. Technology is getting cheaper, better and faster at a big rate which should worry us. Not only that but their are already cars that can drive themselves, this is seen as a good thing because the death rate of car accidents will most likely lower. All of this will leave millions jobless because technology will replace workers and will them with no money.  </p>
	<p> In my personal opinion, I believe that technology might take over us for while but soon it will come to an end. This is because I wonder if these machines and robots will have malfunctions and stop woerking. If that occurs then what will happen? Humans are more reliable and need a way to make money in order to survive, how will they if technology takes over all these jobs? </p>

	<h3> Christian Maravelis </h3>
	<p>  I agree with youre personal opinion, although humans do need money to survive i also belive that robots will make us money if we invest into them, such as Bitcoin. </p>

	<h3> Evan M </h3>
	<p> This was an interesting reading and i also agree that they robots will soon take over us. This also scares me because robots are very advanced and can basically do what us humans can do. </p>

	<p> Knowing Where You Are is one of the sections I read from Blown to Bits. This section was about how Global Position Systems also known as GPS know exactly where you are at all times. GPS can be used in cellphones, cars, etc and can provide you with different types of information. For example if you are on a mountain, a GPS can inform you about how high up the mountain you are.</p>
	<p> The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think talks about parking garages and privacy. Every car that enters the airport garage has its license plate photographed at the same time as the ticket is being taken. If the tickets are accidentally swapped then one car will not be allowed to leave. This raises many questions like who else gets access to the license plate numbers? and how long is the data retained?  </p>
	<p> Why We Lost Our Privacy, or Gave It Away explains to us how we give away our private information without knowing. We lose control of our personal information because of things we do to ourselves, and the things that others do to us. An interesting point from the reading that was made is that we give away information about ourselves voluntarily.  </p>
	<p> This makes me alert because it makes me realize that our personal and private information can be seen my other people and we have no control over it even if we might think we do. These readings made me realize that we give out information about ourselves unintentionally without even noticing which scares me and makes me anxious. In my opinion, I believe that no one has privacy because of all these factors like GPS, our phones, our surroundings. </p>

	<p>  I think its scary to belive that we will lose our privacy, soon we'd lose jobs to robots and they will know everything. </p>


	<h3> Evan M</h3>
	<p> I agree with this because it also makes me anxious that we have no privacy and that anyone can know our information at any moment. </p>
